# Hurricane data

These data come from NOAA's historic hurricanes database at:
http://go.usa.gov/cywdG

It does not appear to be possible to download the data without interacting with the GUI. To download the data, click "Hurricanes" under the gear icon in the upper right, and then click the cloud/arrow download icon.
