## Demographics of Disaster

This repository contains all the code and data associated with a group class project for [Stat 259](http://gastonsanchez.com/stat259), a UC Berkeley course associated with the [Data Sciences for the 21st Century](http://ds421.berkeley.edu) program.

Our final products include a [web app](https://matthewkling.shinyapps.io/demographics_of_disaster/) built with Shiny, and a [report](https://www.overleaf.com/4862930qgjwjv#) compiled with latex. 

The project was motivated by a simple question: *how how are US subpopulations differentially burdened by climate-related natural disasters?* By combining a number of socioeconomic and meteorological datasets into a flexible visualization framework, the Shiny app lets you explore various facets of this issue.

Our pipeline is fully reproducible, and nearly every step is scripted, exceptions being the downloading of several source datasets only accessible via GUI.
