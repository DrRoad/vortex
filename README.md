## Demographics of Disaster

This repository contains all the code and data associated with a group class project for [Stat 259](http://gastonsanchez.com/stat259), a UC Berkeley reproducible data science course associated with the [Data Sciences for the 21st Century](http://ds421.berkeley.edu) program.

Our project generated a [web app](https://matthewkling.shinyapps.io/demographics_of_disaster/) built with Shiny, and a [report](https://www.overleaf.com/4862930qgjwjv#) built with latex. 

The project was motivated by a simple question: *how how are US subpopulations differentially burdened by climate-related natural disasters?* By combining a number of socioeconomic and meteorological datasets into a flexible visualization framework, the Shiny app lets you explore various facets of this issue.
