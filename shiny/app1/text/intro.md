#### Welcome to Demographics of Disaster! 

This tool is motivated by a simple question: *which US subpopulations are most burdened by climate-related natural disasters?* By combining a number of socioeconomic and meteorological datasets into a flexible visualization framework, the app lets you explore various facets of this issue. Click the tabs above to get started.

This app was created by a few UC Berkeley grad students as a class project for the [Data Sciences for the 21st Century](http://ds421.berkeley.edu) program, and is powered by [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com). The project workflow is scripted and fully reproducible. For more details, check out our report or our GitHub repo below.
