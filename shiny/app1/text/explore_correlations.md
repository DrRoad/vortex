These charts visualize bivariate relationships across space. Each point on the scatterplot corresponds to a county on the map. The scatterplot reveals the correlation between the selected variables, and also serves as a two-dimensional color legend for the map.
* To explore the demographics of disaster, choose a social variable for the X dimension and an environmental variable for the Y dimension (or investigate a totally different question by combining variables differently).
* To see a map of a single variable, choose it for both the X and Y dimensions.
* Many variables have skewed distributions -- choose linear, log, or percentile scale transformations to rescale the data.
* Three types of best-fit line are available, with counties weighted by population in these regressions.
* Use the other controls to play with colors, zoom into a single state, download your charts, and more!
